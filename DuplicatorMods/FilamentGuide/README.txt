# Summary

Updated the design by making a interlocking ring thing. I was inspired by thing 1348253 and thought that might resolve my BINDING issue as you reach the top of the z axis. cheaper filament that is brittle sometimes breaks at this point. SO I copied the idea but I only need 2 rings. the filament runs through the "ball" in the middle.

I uploaded 3 additional versions. one is with no ball bearing at all just a larger opening. the other 2 are the ball bearing with a 4mm and 5mm hole to accept a PTFE tube.

I also brought the arm closer in to the center of the printer. there really is no reason to have the arm so far out since the head does not move on Y the BED moves on why. this will reduce the axis bend further though only on Y the head moves on X so that bend will remain. I am hoping the swively thingy will help with this.

I have a big print in progress so I have not printed this yet but see no reason it would be a problem. I will print one tomorrow.

of course this is also a riser lifting the filament holder UP a bit so the larger spools will fit.

Finally got a clean print (bad extruder stepper) and WOW does it work so much better now. the ball pivot really works too.

I am going to make a v5 with a larger hole in the ball pivot to accept a PTFE tube! and I think that mod will about do it for this part!

I am thinking about putting 5 holes in the arm to hold my allen keys but I am not sure if I want to mar its clean lines doing that.
