# Summary

##Conversion adapter cowlings for fans ranging from 120 mm to 25 mm.  
All normal conversions as STL files and the source Solidworks file for customising with very basic constraints that work for most sensible conversions.   

##Edits  
_30th June 2014 edit_: Added dodgy 2 x 80 to 120 mm thing and 40 to 25 mm. Added some new versions of 40-30, 50-30 and 50-40.  

_2nd July 2014 edit_: Added quick CFD of the normal adapter flow and the 2x80 adapter. Clearly showing the inefficiency of design in the 2x80. Well, what can you expect for a quick job.  

_8th Feb 2015 edit_: Added 25 mm to 30 mm. Very quick and dirty. I've been really busy with work recently so can't spend too much time on this at the moment. Screwing will be difficult, perhaps cable ties or wire wrap or string will do the job, at least temporarily.  

_21st May 2015 edit_: Added 140 and 180 to 120 mm.  

_7th March 2016 edit_: Added new 92 to 50 mm adapters with corrected hole sizes on the 50 mm side. There are 2 versions, one with 40 mm spacing between hole centres for the 50 mm side and one with 42 mm spacing. This discrepancy comes about because of differences in datasheets from different manufacturers. So, before printing please be sure to check your dimensions.

_18th March 2016 edit_: Updated 60 to 30. Small side hole spacing was marginally too large.

_6th August 2016 edit_: Added a requested 92-120 mm with thicker construction, square flanges and 20 mm high.

# Post-Printing

## Post-processing

Most of these will require some post-processing.

Filing of mounting holes is almost certainly going to be required.

# Instructions

Essentially a very quick modification of a single conversion adapter.  

_Only_ the 92 - 70mm version has been printed and used by myself but other people seem to have had success with other sizes too.  

##To use:  
Simply print as one normally would an STL file. The files are simply named and self-explanatory. Be prepared for some post-processing, such as filing holes and sanding down messy edges.  

Apparently Solidworks exports STL using a different coordinate system to what it was drawn with. So some of these are badly orientated (often on one of their side edges). They may need rotating if you want them to print in the best/strongest orientation. Rotate using printer software or some other software. The ideal build orientation for most is lying flat, large side down. All models with through holes obey the 45Â° rule of thumb when printed in this orientation.

##To use the Solidworks file:  
It is somewhat more complex but anyone with adequate knowledge of Solidworks should be able to figure out how it works by looking at the named dimensions, feature tree and equations.  
_Main dimensions to change are height of the adapter, thickness of the flanges, wall thickness, size of the upper and lower openings, fixing hole diameters and hole locations._  
There are some combinations that need one to modify the model features themselves to produce a decent part. This was originally a quick job so it is not exactly refined or beautiful.
