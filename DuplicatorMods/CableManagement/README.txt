# Summary

First off this is totally cosmetic and will not make your prints any better. With the extruder stepper motor rotated and the wires behind this I can get the full 180mm Z-height (see picture) even with LED lights installed under the top of my gantry. This will only work in conjunction with my drag link relocation bracket:

My original shroud was designed for my setup with a single X-axis upper block. I added a second STL file with more clearance to accommodate the stock dual block setup. Sorry for the inconvenience this might have caused. Additionally you need to rotate the extruder stepper motor 45 degrees so the wires are facing the rear of the printer.
