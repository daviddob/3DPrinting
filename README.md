# 3D Printing

So you wanted to get into 3D Printing? So did I.
This repo is more or less a history of most of the things I've worked on,
designed from scratch, modified, or found on the internet and wanted to save for
later. Feel free to add to this with optimized profiles, cool models, or
anything applicable to 3D Printing as a whole.

# Layout

- Benchmarks -> Models for testing and calibrating your printer
- CuraProfiles -> Profiles for the Cura Slicing Software (Currently customized
  for the Wanhao Duplicator i3 and Clones)
- Designs -> 3D models to print both practical and fun. Some were designed by
  me, most were not and include a README as to where they were located for
  future reference and instructions (if applicable)
- DuplicatorMods -> All of the mods I have used on my printer at one point or
  another. Most are currently in use, some have been modified along the way or
  replaced to yield better print quality.
