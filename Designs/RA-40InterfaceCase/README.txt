# Summary

For someone putting up a low cost repeater, the cost of a USB Radio Interface for any type can be steep. That's one reason I was thrilled when I found W3KKC's RA-35 -- only problem was, it didn't come with a case.  Well, that can be fixed =]

Here are some things to know about this case:

* No hardware required -- put the RA-35 in and snap the lid shut
* There are holes in the lid placed above each of the three LEDs
* No supports are required



I hope you find it useful =]

Notes: 
Make sure you turn the lid upside down so the flat (top) side is down else it won't likely work real well =]
