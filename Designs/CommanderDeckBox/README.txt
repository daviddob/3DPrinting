# Summary

This deck box will comfortably fit 100 sleeved Magic: The Gathering cards. 


I printed Archimiedies' MTG Dragon Deck Box for my new commander deck, only to find that it will not fit a sleeved commander deck. The design is awesome, though, so I tinkered with it until I found a size I liked better. I also made the lid fit a little tighter so that it won't fall off in my backpack. 

Yes, I realize my pictures are sideways. They were not when I uploaded them. Anyone have any advice on how to fix that? Thanks!
