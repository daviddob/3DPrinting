# Summary

Mini Floor Stands are just that... a fairly large range of small stand with fun / warning / safety messages. They are a print-in-place design with two sign faces plus an arm to lock the stand in place. Easy prints for practical and fun applications... just click on the Files tab to view the range. A blank option is also available that can be edited (add text) or used with an adhesive sticker, piece of card or similar.  

A colour change is required as soon as you see the letters starting to form. Just pause your machine, change the filament then re-start and finish your sign. Use whatever colors you want as long as there is adequate contrast between the stand part and the text.  

Mini Floor Signs are a great way to communicate a message at home or at work. They are fun little things that, in many instances, have practical value. Use them to good effect!

Mini Floor Stands can be scaled up readily and also scaled down by a small amount. If your slicing app and machine are precise 80% of standard size has been reported to work okay. This is handy for members with smaller machines. You can also rotate them in your slicer to make them print on a smaller build plate.  

Please refer to the print settings and information for additional information... and post images of your Mini Floor Stands in use for others to see. 

And, if you like this design, check out the rest of my fun and practical designs.
